# Tutedude Python Assignments

This repository contains my Python assignments and solutions for the Tutedude Python course.

## Structure

Instead of creating multiple repositories for each assignment, I have organized all the assignments within this single repository.  
Each assignment is placed in a separate folder, named accordingly:

- Assignment-1
- Assignment-2
- Assignment-3
- Assignment-4
- Assignment-5

Each folder contains the assignment files and a README file specific to that assignment (where required), describing the problem statement and my solution approach.

## How to Navigate

- Browse the repository and open the folder of the assignment you want to view.
- Inside each folder, you will find:
  - The Python code file(s) for the assignment.
  - A README file (if needed) explaining the task and my solution.

## About Me

This repository is part of my learning journey with Python through the Tutedude course.  
I am maintaining this repo to track my progress and practice version control using Git and GitHub.
